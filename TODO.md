## Notes

### Dashboard Architecture
All core dashboard pages have been successfully migrated to the new server component pattern:
- Uses `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` for fresh data
- Server actions with `overrideAccess: true` for mutations
- TanStack Query removed to eliminate hydration issues
- Pattern documented in CLAUDE.md

### Email System Status
Basic email functionality is working:
- Client registration triggers admin notification
- Form submissions send emails with template support
- Uses Payload's `sendEmail()` with dynamic field substitution

*Last Updated: January 2025*
*Priority: High priority items should be tackled first*
